node.js:
[1] Install https://node.js.org/en/download/

[2] cmd -> node -v

[3] Create a new folder named as learn-node-mysql

[4] Create app.js file inside learn-node-mysql

[5] Open Cmd and Go to folder learn-node-mysql And Run command : node app.js

[6] window object is the global object of javascript while running javascript in browser.
console.log("Hello World");
window.console.log("Hello World");
setTimeout(function(){ console.log("Hello World") },1000);
window.setTimeout(function(){ console.log("Hello World") },1000);

When declare variable using var it also available in window object.
var myVariable = "I am a simple variable";
console.log(myVariable);
console.log(window.myVariable);

[7] Run command : node simpleObject.js
Like window object in browser javascript, global object is available in node.js
Every single javascript file inside node.js like app.js, simpleObject.js are known as modules inside node.js.
app.js and simpleObject.js is a module.

[8] We have main module or entry module. Suppose it is app.js here. So app.js is main module or entry module.
But other javascript files are normal module.

[9] If we have many normal modules and in all those normal modules we have some properties, functions. So how can we use those in main module.

[10] Each module in node.js has its own context. So it cannot interfere with another module.
Suppose we have filea.js
Inside filea.js we have some properties and functions.
Let suppose we have another file fileb.js inside that we have the same properties and functions.
While defining into a single file, all the variables with the same name either it may be properties or functions will override inside each other.
But if we write in different modules then the are not interfere with their functionality.

[11] Node.js includes 3 types of modules:
a) Core modules [http, os, fs etc]
b) Local modules [user custom module]
c) third party modules [cors, mysql etc]
